This file is to help make sense of the various update sql scripts that is under this folder.

This ought to be updated as the scripts are added.

1. re_add_view_flights_roles_update.sql
- This script is intended to be run as an update on an existing installation.
- View Flights as a role was re-added conceptually and is the default role. This script adds the role 'View Flights'
with role id 9 to the role table. It then adds that role to each user in the user_role table.
